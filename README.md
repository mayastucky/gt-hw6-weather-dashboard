# gt-hw6-weather-dashboard

## Description

This fun and easy to use application lets a user search for their desired city and view the variables like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index. It also lets users look ahead to the next 5 days and prepare for the weather later on in the week.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run index.html in your browser.

## Usage

This application uses jQuery and API calls to make an interactive weather application.

## Credits

This was a solo project completed as homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Flex Program. As always, many thanks to my peers who are always willing to work out the kinks together.
